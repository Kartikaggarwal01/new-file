Honorable Chair, distinguished delegates,

The global financial system is at a pivotal moment. For decades, the U.S. dollar has been the dominant force in international trade and finance, but this has left countries like Turkey vulnerable to economic shocks, sanctions, and financial instability, all tied to a currency we do not control.

Turkey believes the time has come for a more multipolar financial system—one that does not rely on a single currency but instead embraces a diverse range of currencies, digital assets, and commodities. We envision a system that enhances financial independence, builds resilience, and fosters global economic stability.

We have already begun taking steps. Turkey has expanded currency swap agreements with partners like China and Qatar, increased gold reserves, and started exploring alternatives for energy trade outside the dollar. But this is just the beginning.

We call on the international community to work with us in advancing central bank digital currencies, promoting trade in local currencies, and even considering commodity-backed currencies to create a more stable financial system.

As a bridge between East and West, Turkey is ready to lead this effort and partner with nations worldwide to create a financial system that reflects the diversity of the 21st century.

Thank you.


// some points to be considered
*Here are a few suggestions to further strengthen your statement:

*Highlight the historical context of U.S. dollar dominance: This would emphasize why the shift is necessary and provide some background for newer delegates.
*Mention BRICS and regional efforts: BRICS nations are already discussing alternatives to the U.S. dollar. Turkey could align itself with these discussions or refer to them as supporting evidence for a multipolar currency system.
*Add a humanitarian angle: Emphasize that a diversified financial system will benefit smaller economies and developing countries, which often suffer from financial instability due to dollar dependence.
*Underline the role of emerging technologies: You mentioned central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), but reinforcing the potential of blockchain, digital tokens, and fintech in this shift might make the argument more forward-thinking.

Here’s a slightly enhanced version of your statement incorporating these suggestions:
